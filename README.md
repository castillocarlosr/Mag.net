## Overall problem domain
    The project team wanted to exapand on a previous project that had included placing digital refrigerator magnets on a digital refrigerator and arranging them how the user saw fit.

This is where using meme and full word API's came into use.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
* The application is a mobile first (currently mobile only) game.  Languages uses is html, css, javascript with JQuery, AJAX, EJS, and postgres database.
* The application is a fun game that allows registered user to arrange a community fridge for other resigstered to see.  The frigde updates the server every 10 seconds so other users can see in "semi"-real time what other users are writing with magnets on the fridge.  The possible combinations are vast.
